## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to sports statistics. I am most interested in basketball statistics and I am not sure which specific variables I would want to examine yet. If I can find the data, I would be more interested in looking towards college basketball statistics because I am in college but also because the NBA is far more refined in its implementation of analytics whereas college basketball still has a ways to go in terms of using basketball analytics to best gain an advantage.
